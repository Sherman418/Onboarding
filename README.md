# Onboarding

This scrip was created for an environemnt with on-prem AD and separate O365 email accounts.\
It can be used by either setting up department "models", or by simply entering an existing username and copying groups from them.\

Required modules:\
	-ActiveDirectory\
	-MSOnline\
	-AzureAD\
\
--Have noticed some strange errors if PowerShell is not being run as administrator\
--Seems to work fine being run locally on a system with RSAT installed
